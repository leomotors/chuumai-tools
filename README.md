## Chunithm

(For Internation Ver.)

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Simple Usage

```
docker run --rm \
 -v ./outputs:/app/outputs \
 -e USERNAME=YOUR_SEGA_ID \
 -e PASSWORD=YOUR_SEGA_PASSWORD \
 -e VERSION=VRS \
 -e IMAGE_GEN_URL=https://chuni.wonderhoy.me \
 -e TZ=Asia/Bangkok \
 -e LANG=th_TH.UTF-8 \
 ghcr.io/leomotors/chunithm-scraper:v4
```

You will have to change `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` to your own,
`TZ` and `LANG` so that the image show timezone and time format correctly.

This basic command will scrape your data and save both json and image into `outputs` folder.

> [!WARNING]
> If you use Docker Desktop on Windows, when using `-v` option, make sure to start with `//` and use absolute path. For example: `-v //c/Users/username/outputs:/app/outputs`

### Advanced Usage
